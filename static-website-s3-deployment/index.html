            <p>
                I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,<br>
                From the seas and the streams;<br>
                I bear light shade for the leaves when laid<br>
                In their noonday dreams.<br>
                From my wings are shaken the dews that waken<br>
                The sweet buds every one,<br>
                When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,<br>
                As she dances about the sun.<br><br>
                
                I wield the flail of the lashing hail,<br>
                And whiten the green plains under;<br>
                And then again I dissolve it in rain,<br>
                And laugh as I pass in thunder.<br>
                I am the daughter of Earth and Water,<br>
                And the nursling of the Sky;<br>
                I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;<br>
                I change, but I cannot die.<br>
